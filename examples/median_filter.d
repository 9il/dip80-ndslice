A median filter is implemented as an example. The function
`movingWindowByChannel` can also be used with other filters that use a sliding
window as the argument, in particular with convolution matrices such as the
$(LINK2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator, Sobel operator).

`movingWindowByChannel` iterates over an image in sliding window mode.
Each window is transferred to a `filter`, which calculates the value of the
pixel that corresponds to the given window.

This function does not calculate border cases in which a window overlaps
the image partially. However, the function can still be used to carry out such
calculations. That can be done by creating an amplified image, with the edges
reflected from the original image, and then applying the given function to the
new file.

Note: You can find the example at
$(LINK2 https://github.com/DlangScience/examples/tree/master/image_processing/median-filter, GitHub).

Params:
    filter = unary function. Dimension window 2D is the argument.
    image = image dimensions `(h, w, c)`,
        where с is the number of channels in the image
    nr = number of rows in the window
    nс = number of columns in the window

Returns:
    image dimensions `(h - nr + 1, w - nc + 1, c)`,
        where с is the number of channels in the image.
        Dense data layout is guaranteed.
